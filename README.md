# You're Doing Great

## Inspiration
It took us a while to think of an idea for this project- after a long day of zoom school, we sat down on Friday with very little motivation to do work. As we pushed through this lack of drive our friends in the other room would offer little encouragements to keep us going and we started to realize just how powerful those comments are. For all people working online, and university students in particular, the struggle to balance life on and off the screen is difficult. We often find ourselves forgetting to do daily tasks like drink enough water or even just take a small break, and, when we do, there is very often negativity towards the idea of rest. This is where You're Doing Great comes in.

## What it does
Our web application is focused on helping students and online workers alike stay motivated throughout the day while making the time and space to care for their physical and mental health. Users are able to select different kinds of activities that they want to be reminded about (e.g. drinking water, eating food, movement, etc.) and they can also input messages that they find personally motivational. Then, throughout the day (at their own predetermined intervals) they will receive random positive messages, either through text or call, that will inspire and encourage. There is also an additional feature where users can send messages to friends so that they can share warmth and support because we are all going through it together. Lastly, we understand that sometimes positivity and understanding aren't enough for what someone is going through and so we have a list of further resources available on our site.

## How we built it
We built it using:

 - AWS
  - DynamoDB
  - Lambda
  - Cognito
  - APIGateway
  - Amplify
 - React
  - Redux
  - React-Dom
  - MaterialUI
 - serverless
 - Twilio
 - Domain.com
 - Netlify
## Challenges we ran into
Centring divs should not be so difficult :( Transferring the name servers from domain.com to Netlify Serverless deploying with dependencies

## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Our logo! It works :)

## What we learned
We learned how to host a domain and we improved our front-end html/css skills

## What's next for You're Doing Great
We could always implement more reminder features and we could refine our friends feature so that people can only include selected individuals. Additionally, we could add a chatbot functionality so that users could do a little check in when they get a message.
